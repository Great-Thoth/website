<p> <strong>A middle aged curmudgeon with nearly 50 years of gaming behind me!<br>I am the Great Thoth!</strong></p>

<h3>My Reasons For Doing This</h3>

<div id="text">
<p>I've been a gamer for many years as I mentioned, but increasingly I have started to realise that the entire industry is youth focused! The fact that I still play games and enjoy them seems to be a source of humour for Twitch, YouTube and Tik Tok!<br> What these sites and their young viewers don't twig though is that video gaming is probably older than their parents.</p>
<p>The first acknowledged video game was Space Wars, which was programmed on a computer that was bigger than a Volvo in 1962; but as early as 1952, on a computer built with valves, people were playing Tic Tac Toe;(Noughts and Crosses for us Brits). So video gaming is likely to be as old as their grandparents. </p>
<br>
<p>Gaming is the ultimate escape and shouldn't be restricted to hipsters and young 'uns! I'm part of the first acknowledged generation of computer gamers and I want to share that with you.</p>

<h3>Why Old Guys Gaming</h3>
<div id="text">
<p>Put simply, I want to afford people like myself an opportunity to indulge the hobby they've pursued since the days of early consoles like the Atari 2600; or even earlier, if like me your first machine was a Binatone Pong system. I want a place where I can talk about the difficulty spikes in modern games; and where telling people you've just finished Dark Souls on easy for the first time doesn't elicit laughter. I'm hoping this will be the place! </p>
