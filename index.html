<div id="text">
<br>
<p>Welcome to the first incarnation of what I hope will be a website that allows all those first and second generation video gamers; and you know who are; to have a place where they can read up on their hobby. Where they can reminisce about text based games like Zork; and where nobody is too old to play computer games; except maybe <b>Fortnite!</b></p>
<br>
<p>So if your Elder Scrolls character needs a zimmer, and your Sims are in need of a deaf aid; or you really want to understand why your Call of Duty GI gets creamed 99 times out of 100; then this is the place for you!</p>
